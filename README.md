# N8N AI Agents Masterclass

# A practical collection of n8n workflows, templates, and guides for building intelligent AI agent automations.
# This repository provides ready‑to‑import workflow JSON files, setup instructions, and examples for using n8n as a low‑code AI automation platform.

# ---------------------------
# Overview
# ---------------------------
# n8n is an open‑source no‑code/low‑code workflow automation platform that lets you visually connect triggers, nodes, APIs, AI models, and tools into intelligent logic flows.
# This masterclass repository contains a series of agent examples built with n8n that demonstrate how to design, orchestrate, and deploy AI agent workflows integrating LLMs, triggers, tool nodes, and external services. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

# ---------------------------
# What’s in This Repository
# ---------------------------
# Example workflows for different AI agent types (e.g., email automation, calendar handling, content creation)
# JSON templates for importing into your own n8n instance
# Installation and setup guides to get started quickly
# Reference documentation for core n8n nodes used in AI agent patterns
# Sample assets and workflow collections that illustrate real automation scenarios

# ---------------------------
# Getting Started
# ---------------------------
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/softbusinesss/N8N-AI-Agents-Masterclass.git
cd N8N-AI-Agents-Masterclass

# Import the workflow JSON files into your n8n instance
# Open n8n
# Choose Import Workflow
# Select a JSON file from the workflows folder

# ---------------------------
# Setup
# ---------------------------
# Install n8n (self‑hosted or cloud) if you don’t already have it running
# Set up credentials for services you will connect (OpenAI API keys, email providers, calendar APIs, etc.)
# Follow the included setup guide files in the repository (e.g., Installation and Credential setup markdowns)

# ---------------------------
# How to Use the Workflows
# ---------------------------
# Each workflow JSON corresponds to one agent pattern
# Import it into n8n to see the node flow
# Configure credentials and inputs for the nodes
# Run or trigger the workflow manually, on a schedule, or via webhook

# ---------------------------
# Examples Included
# ---------------------------
# Email‑handling agent workflows
# Supervisor/Coordinator agent templates
# Content creator and automation examples
# Contact and calendar management agent flows :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

# ---------------------------
# Why This Is Useful
# ---------------------------
# Provides ready‑built n8n patterns that demonstrate AI automation in action
# Helps you prototype intelligent agents without writing backend integrations
# Supports learning n8n automation best practices and AI agent design

# ---------------------------
# Notes
# ---------------------------
# The workflows assume you have access to appropriate APIs and credentials
# All code and workflow files are under the project’s open‑source license (adjust as needed)
# Tailor the JSON templates to fit your own use cases and data

# ---------------------------
# Contributing
# ---------------------------
# Contributions are welcome
# Improve workflow templates, add new AI agent patterns, and update documentation
# Follow the contributing guidelines included in this repository

# ---------------------------
# License
# ---------------------------
# This project is provided under the repository’s chosen open‑source license (e.g., MIT)
